    <h1>Learning to code</h1>
    <p id="header-description">I will upload videos and playlists that i watched while learning full stack website development.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="explanation">
          <p>This is a step by step guide.</p>
    <p>But, DO NOT JUST WATCH THIS VIDEOS, actually go out there and build, play around with code, break things, fix them, grow, google for how to do stuff that you don't know or understand. We even have stuff like <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude AI</a> and <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a> and other AIs to help and assist you on your learning journey.</p>
    <p>But, BEWARE: DO NOT LET CHATGPT AND ANY OTHER AI BECOME A CRUTCH YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT, WRITE THE CODE YOURSELF, DON'T JUST COPY THE CODE AND SAY IT'S FINE BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THE CODE, WRITE THE CODE YOURSELF, PLAY AROUND WITH IT, CHECK OUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK.</p>
    <p>NOTE: You don't have to watch the full playlists or the full videos, they are just guides, the main thing is to practice, i'm only putting the videos so that you will watch it and understand where to start.</p>

    <section id="full-stack">
        <section id="front-end">
            <h2>These are the front-end videos/playlists</h2>
            <p>Remember, don't just watch, actually practice and work with it</p>
            <p>If you watch without practicing, it will be like when a baby watches how to walk without actually walking and then expecting to know how to walk</p>
            <p>Do not be scared of failure. A baby has to fall a lot before he/she knows how to actually work. It's only when you fail that you know what doesn't work and know how to avoid these. So don't be afraid to fail â€” that's how real learning happens.</p>
            <section id="html-and-css">
                <h3>This is the playlist for HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
                <p>HTML and CSS should be the first thing you learn on your path to web development. It is very important. It is the foundation of website development. Don't listen to bad advice like 'Learn React' or 'Learn Angular'. HTML, CSS and JS are the basics of web development.</p>

                <p>You should probably learn Git and GitHub because even though you're not going to see it in a lot of roadmaps, you're going to need it or love it. It helps and it's an essential tool for developers</p>
