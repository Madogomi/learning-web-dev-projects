    <h1>How To Monetize My Crime and Safety Intelligence Platform</h1>
    <p>
      I plan to create a website where users can check for the most dangerous
      areas, the places with the most security, the areas with the highest crime
      rate and so on, this is a table on ways to monetize it
    </p>
    <p>The platform will be called <span>SecureStreet</span></p>
